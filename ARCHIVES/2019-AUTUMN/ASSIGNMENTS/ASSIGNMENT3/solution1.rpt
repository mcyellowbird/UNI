/* (3)	Next, the script inserts into a relational table MESSAGE information about the contents of a sample database that violate 
        the following consistency constraint.
											
	"All orders submitted after 30 April 2019 must not include discontinued products"                                                 

        The script must list the outcomes of verification of the consistency constraint as a single column table with the following 
        messages as the rows in the table.

        Order <insert order_id here> includes a discontinued product <insert product_name here>

        For example, if order_id of an order submitted on 1 May 2019 is equal to 278 and product Chai is discontinued and the product is 
        included into the order then verification of the consistency constraint must return the following message.

        Order 278 submitted on 2019-05-01 includes a discontinued product Chai

	Use a function CONCAT to create the messages like the one listed above.                                                           */
