							Heat the olive oil in a large casserole and gently fry the onions, garlic, coriander stalks and chillies for 5 minutes until softened. Stir through the spices and oregano and cook for 2 minutes more.
						</li>
						<li>
							Turn the heat up to medium-high, add the beef mince and brown it well, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Once browned, add the tomato purée and cook over a medium heat for 2 minutes, then add the red wine, allowing it to reduce to a sticky sauce – this will take about 2 minutes.

Taste and adjust the heat (with chilli flakes) and seasoning. Top with the coriander leaves and serve with steamed rice and lime wedges.
