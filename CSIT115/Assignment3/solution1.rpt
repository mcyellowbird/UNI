(2)	Next, write one SQL statement to insert into the relational table MESSAGE information about the contents of a sample database that verifies the consistency constraint 
    for each driver of all driving schedules.											
    " The different driving schedules assigned to a driver must not overlap with each other."

    The script must insert the outcomes of the consistency constraint verifications as a single column table with the following messages as the rows in the table.

    A driver <insert driver licence number here> schedule <insert schedule number here> between <insert start date time here> and <insert end date time here> 
    overlapped with schedule <insert schedule number here> between <insert the start date time here> and < insert end date time here>.

    For example, if a driver 101 schedule 1 between 2018-10-01 15:30:00 and 2019-10-10 16:20:00 overlapped with schedule 20 between 2018-10-05 8:00:00 and 2019-01-10 17:00:00, 
    then verification of the consistency constraint must return the following message.

    A driver 101 schedule 1 between 2018-10-01 15:30:00 and 2019-10-10 16:20:00  overlapped with schedule 20 between 2018-10-05 8:00:00 and 2019-01-10 17:00:00.

    Use a function CONCAT to create the messages like the one listed above.
	
	Note that if two schedules of a driver overlapped, only insert one row of the verification message for the pair.
