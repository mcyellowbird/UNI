In this task, we use a sample database available for the final project.

Before you start the implementation of this task, please make sure that you remove all tables in the csit115 database. 
Download the files dbcreate_final.sql and dbdrop_final.sql. Next, process a script file dbdrop_final.sql immediately after the scripts dbcreate_final.sql to refresh a sample database in the csit115 database. 
No report expected from the processing of the scripts dbdrop_final.sql and dbcreate_final.sql.
